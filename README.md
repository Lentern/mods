# The Best Performance (and Quality-of-Life) Mods for Minecraft 1.21

This is the most up-to-date list of the mods that I personally use while playing Minecraft. From tripling performance to revamped menus, these mods improve your gameplay experience without changing vanilla gameplay.

If you see an ❌ next to a version (eg: "1.21.10 ❌"), that means that the mod is not updated for that version (as far as I know). If there is a ✔, it is updated. Sometimes, mods work for new versions but don't say it on the Modrinth page. If so, check my list to see if I've tested it.

## You must install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) to run these mods

# FAQ

### Why can't I download these all in one modpack? Why do I have to download them all individually?

- Some mod developers don't allow the use of their mods in modpacks. Plus, mods get outdated quickly, and it's important to keep these mods updated when possible. So, I don't want to make a ZIP file full of mods that will be outdated by the next day. Downloading the newest version of each mod individually will create the best in-game experience for you.

### Is [mod name] updated for the newest version?

- Some mods will work on new versions, but won't necessarily tell you on the download page yet. If a mod says on Modrinth that it isn't updated, refer to my notes below to see if it may still work.

### My game is crashing any time I load a world/server, what's going on?

- If you get a crash any time you load a world or join a server, remove the Chat Patches mod. If that fixes it, add the mod back and then delete the file "chatlog.json" file in _.minecraft\logs_. This will reset your chat history and fix the crash. If this doesn't fix it, start removing mods, half of them at a time, until you find the culprit, and then get googling or leave a comment on my video about which mod it is.

### Will these mods affect my builds/redstone/farms?

- In theory, no. I made this list with the goal of staying true to vanilla while also improving the experience. If you notice an issue with your world, start removing mods, half of them at a time, until you figure out which mod is causing an issue, and report the issue to the mod developers (or check if it has already been reported or fixed in a newer version ). It could also be a setting within the mod that should have been toggled, and was unintentionally impeding your experience. To avoid this, use my mod configs, linked above.

## Different Types of Mods

- Performance
  - Performance mods make your game run better and smoother like increasing your frame rate or making chunks load faster.
- Quality-of-life
  - Quality-of-life mods make the Minecraft experience better overall, with features like displaying coordinates or copying screenshots to your computer's clipboard for easy access.
- Dependency
  - Dependency mods are mods that are really only used to make other mods work, like how most mods require Fabric API to run, even though the mod doesn't do anything to the game on its own.

### Bonus mod (might not work because I have had some issues)

- [Technopig](https://modrinth.com/mod/technomodel)
