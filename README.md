# The Best Performance (and Quality-of-Life) Mods for Minecraft 1.21

This is the most up-to-date list of the mods that I personally use while playing Minecraft. From tripling performance to revamping menus, these mods improve your gameplay experience without changing vanilla gameplay.

Want my mod configs? [Here you go](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1amMFKcRSWMBUf3ZmyKpcby5JMFJUhL8b/view).

## You must install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) to run these mods

# FAQ

### My game is crashing, what's going on?

- If you get a crash any time you load a world or join a server, remove the Chat Patches mod. If that fixes it, add the mod back and then delete the file "chatlog.json" file in _.minecraft\logs_. This will reset your chat history and fix the crash. If this doesn't fix it, start removing mods, half of them at a time, until you find the culprit, and then get googling or leave a comment on my video about which mod it is.

### Will these mods affect/break my builds/redstone/farms/gameplay?

- In theory, no. I made this list with the goal of staying true to vanilla while also improving the experience. If you notice an issue with your world, start removing mods, half of them at a time, until you figure out which mod is causing an issue, and report the issue to the mod developers (or check if it has already been reported or fixed in a newer version ). It could also be a setting within the mod that should have been toggled, and was unintentionally impeding your experience. To avoid this, use my mod configs, linked above.
