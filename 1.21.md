# The Best Performance (and Quality-of-Life) Mods for Minecraft
This is the most up-to-date list of the mods that I personally use while playing Minecraft. From tripling performance to revamped menus, these mods improve your gameplay experience without changing vanilla gameplay.

If you see an ❌ next to a version (eg: "1.21 ❌"), that means that the mod is not updated for that version (as far as I know). If there is a ✔, it is updated.

## Why can't I download these all in one folder? Why do I have to download them all individually?
Not every mod is legally allowed to be distributed in modpacks. Some mods' license agreements say you can't include their mod in a modpack without explicit permission, and that really isn't worth it here. Plus, mods get outdated quickly, and, unlike in a proper modpack, it's important to keep all of these mods updated. So, I don't want to make a legally questionable ZIP file full of mods that will be outdated the next day. Downloading each mod individually is the best way to have the best in-game experience.

## Notices
* I have listed required mods, meaning I've only listed mods that another mod will ***need*** for the game to start
* Some of these mods will require Mod Menu to be configured. If you still can't configure a mod after installing Mod Menu, install Cloth Config API
* If you're using Sodium and you get a crash (or another weird bug) that is caused by another mod, install Indium and that will hopefully fix it (ex. Continuity uses the Fabric Rendering API, so it requires Indium to work with Sodium)
* If you see a * next to a checkmark for a version, that means the mod is usable but may be a little bit broken
* Some mods will work on new versions, but it won't tell you on the download page. Refer to my guides below to see if mods are updated

## You must install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) to run these mods

## Different Types of Mods
* Performance
  * Performance mods make your game run better and smoother like increasing your frame rate or making chunks load faster
* Quality-of-life
  * Quality-of-life mods make the Minecraft experience better overall, like always displaying coordinates in game or copying screenshots to your computer's clipboard for easy access
* Dependency
  * Dependency mods are mods that are really only used to make other mods work, like how most mods require Fabric API to run, even though the mod doesn't do anything to the game on its own
